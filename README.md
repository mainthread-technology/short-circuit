## Setting up Google Play Services Nearby
Follow [this](https://developers.google.com/nearby/messages/android/get-started) guide to obtain a API key for the nearby API. Once obtained add it to the manifest file.

I recommend replacing 'keys/shortcircuit.keystore' with a new one before obtaining an API key for it.
